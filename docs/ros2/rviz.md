# Rviz: The ROS 2 Visualization Tool

## 👁️ What is Rviz?
**Rviz (ROS Visualization)** is a 3D visualization tool used to display data from ROS 2 topics. It is not a simulator (it doesn't calculate physics), but a powerful debugging and analysis tool for monitoring the state of your robot and its environment.

## Key Visualization Capabilities
Rviz subscribes to standard ROS 2 message types and renders them into a visual context, allowing developers to immediately verify if their code is working correctly.

* **Robot Model:** Displays the robot's structure (URDF) and its current position in 3D space, based on joint state messages.
* **Sensor Data:**
    * **LiDAR/Point Clouds:** Renders laser scan data as a collection of 3D points, allowing you to see objects detected by the robot.
    * **Image:** Displays raw or processed camera images.
* **Maps and Paths:** Visualizes 2D occupancy grids (maps) and the planned paths generated by the navigation stack (Nav2).
* **Coordinate Frames (TF):** Displays the relationship between all coordinate frames (`base_link`, `camera_link`, `odom`, etc.), which is essential for understanding spatial transformations.

## Rviz vs. Gazebo/Isaac Sim
