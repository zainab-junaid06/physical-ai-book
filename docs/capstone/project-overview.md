# Capstone Project Overview: The Autonomous Humanoid

## 🚀 Goal of the Capstone
The Capstone Project integrates all course modules, bridging the digital brain (AI models) with the physical body (humanoid robot) in a simulated environment. The final deliverable is an autonomous, conversational humanoid agent.

## 🤖 The Capstone Scenario
The simulated robot must receive a **voice command** (Module 4: VLA), **plan a path** (Module 3: Isaac Nav2), **navigate obstacles**, **identify an object** using computer vision, and **manipulate** it.

## Key Learning Outcomes Applied
* **ROS 2:** Using the framework for communication and control.
* **Gazebo/Isaac Sim:** Physics-accurate simulation environment.
* **Isaac ROS:** Hardware-accelerated perception and navigation (VSLAM).
* **VLA/LLMs:** Translating natural language into executable robot actions.

## Deliverables & Assessment
* **Code Submission:** A complete ROS 2 workspace containing all packages.
* **Demo Video:** Showcasing the robot successfully executing the full voice-to-action pipeline.
* **Report:** Documenting the system architecture, design decisions, and sim-to-real considerations.
