# Control Systems

Robot control = calculating motor commands for accurate movement.

## 🔹 PID Control

Most common control loop:

- P → reacts to error  
- I → removes offset errors  
- D → stabilizes  

Used everywhere:
- drones  
- motors  
- ROS2 Control

## 🔹 Feedforward Control

Predicts the torque needed BEFORE the robot moves.  
Uses:
- mass  
- inertia  
- friction  

Combines with PID for smooth motion.

## 🔹 Impedance Control

Makes a robot feel “soft” or “springy”.

Useful for:
- human-robot interaction  
- safe contact  
- assembly tasks  

---

## 🔹 Model Predictive Control (MPC)

Advanced, uses optimization.  
Great for:
- humanoids  
- drones  
- self-driving cars
