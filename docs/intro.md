#  Introduction to Physical AI

**Physical AI** is the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence, and real-world interaction. Unlike traditional AI that exists purely in software, Physical AI **embeds intelligence into machines that act and sense in the real world**. 🌎🤖

This course covers:

- **Robotics Fundamentals** 🦾  
  Learn about robot structures, joints, actuators, and sensors that allow machines to move and interact with their environment.  

- **Humanoids** 🧍‍♂️  
  Explore human-like robots, their kinematics, dynamics, and control strategies for walking, grasping, and interacting safely.  

- **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)** 🔗  
  Understand how robots communicate, sense, and act using ROS 2 topics, services, actions, and nodes.  

- **Simulation with Gazebo** 🎮  
  Use Gazebo to create **realistic physics-based simulations**, including sensors, obstacles, and complex environments, without risking hardware damage.  

- **Control & Automation** ⚡  
  Implement **PID controllers, trajectory planning, and motion control** for precise robotic behavior.  

- **Vision & Perception** 👀  
  Integrate cameras, LiDAR, and depth sensors for **object detection, segmentation, SLAM, and navigation**.  

- **Digital Twins & Isaac Sim** 🪞  
  Create **virtual replicas of real robots** for testing, training, and generating synthetic data for AI models.

## 🎯 Course Goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Build and simulate robotic systems in **Gazebo**.  
2. Program and control robots using **ROS 2**.  
3. Implement **robot perception and vision systems**.  
4. Design **humanoid and manipulator control pipelines**.  
5. Leverage **digital twins and simulation tools** to accelerate real-world robot development.
