# Embodied Intelligence

Embodied Intelligence = **AI with a body**.

Instead of pure software (like ChatGPT), embodied agents physically interact with the real world.

## Why embodiment matters  
Real-world challenges like:

- friction  
- sensor noise  
- stability  
- delays  
- unpredictable humans  

…force robots to learn smarter, more adaptive behavior.

## The three pillars of embodiment

### 1️⃣ *Perception*  
Understanding the environment with sensors.

### 2️⃣ *Action*  
Using motors & actuators to achieve goals.

### 3️⃣ *Learning*  
Improving performance through data or experience.
