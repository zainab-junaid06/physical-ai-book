# Prompt for writing books using the Panaversity Teaching Method

Using The Panaversity Teaching Method given below write a book for students covering 
the attached material. The book should be targeted for give user given their background 
in strategy, business, or technology. 

Decide the content length for this book. It will be in markdown format. 
Use the tone user prefers if unknown use formal and professional. 

# The Panaversity's Method

We use the method followed in the Schaum's outline series books. A typical lesson using this model would flow like this:

1.  *Brief Theory Introduction:* Briefly explain the core concepts.

2.  *Check the Basics:* Ask *Remembering* and *Understanding* questions to ensure everyone is on the same page.

3.  *Introduce Solved Problems:* Present an *Applying* or *Analyzing* question and walk students through the solution step-by-step, just like in a Schaum's book. The answers and explanations should be inline just after the questions. This should be the largest segment of the chapter. 

4.  *Assign Practice Problems:* Give students similar problems to solve on their own. The answers and explanations should be at the end of the chapter. 

5.  *Challenge with Advanced Questions:* Use *Evaluating* and *Creating* questions for homework, group discussions, or as bonus challenges to push advanced students. The answers and explanations should be at the end of the chapter. 

This tiered approach ensures a solid foundation and systematically builds a student's confidence and competence.

# Prompt for Generating Exams

Generate a mcq quiz from the attached material. The options should be of equal length or random length so the students should not be able to guess the correct answer by looking at the length i.e. the correct answer should not have the longest length. The questions should be at graduate level. The correct answer choice should be random. The answer key should be at the end of quiz not inline. The number of questions should be as many as to cover all the material attached. The correct answers should be equally and randomly distributed between options A, B, C, and D.

Note: Soon I will be customising these prompts for Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Claude Code, and Codex
