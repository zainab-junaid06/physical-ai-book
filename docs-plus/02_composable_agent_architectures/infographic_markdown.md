### Composable Approach ✅

- ✓ Compose from reusable skills
- ✓ Hours to days deployment
- ✓ 99% cost reduction
- ✓ Global marketplace access
- ✓ Standard A2A protocol
- ✓ Revenue generating asset

## 🏗️ The Architecture: 4 Layers

### **Layer 1: Skills Layer**
**Reusable, portable modules of functional capability. Write once, use everywhere.**

`Docker` • `Kubernetes` • `Dapr` • `A2A` • `GitHub`

---

### **Layer 2: Subagent Layer**
**Domain-specialized cognitive units composed of system prompt + skills + MCP connections.**

`DevOps Agent` • `Finance Agent` • `Data Agent` • `Security Agent`

---

### **Layer 3: Protocol Layer**
**Standardized communication: MCP (agent↔systems) + A2A (agent↔agents) with built-in billing.**

`Authentication` • `Authorization` • `Metering` • `Audit Logging`

---

### **Layer 4: Economic Layer**
**Identity, registry, billing, and trust infrastructure enabling the Agentic Economy.**

`DID Identity` • `Agent Registry` • `Billing Gateway` • `Trust Scores`

---

## 📊 Impact by Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Cost Reduction** | 99% |
| **Development Speed** | 10x Faster |
| **Price per Call** | $0.10 |
| **Trust Score** | 98.7/100 |

---

## ⚙️ How the Agentic Economy Works

### **Step 1: Provider Publishes Agent**
Developer creates DevOps agent and registers in marketplace with DID, pricing, and capabilities

↓

### **Step 2: Consumer Discovers**
Search registry by domain, review trust scores, pricing, SLA guarantees, and user ratings

↓

### **Step 3: Invocation via A2A**
Consumer calls agent through A2A protocol with DID authentication and usage metering

↓

### **Step 4: Automatic Billing**
Usage tracked, receipt signed, payment settled:
- Consumer: -$0.12
- Provider: +$0.108 (90%)
- Platform: +$0.012 (10%)
