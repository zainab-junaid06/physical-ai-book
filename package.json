  "description": "> **SpecifyPlus**: It enables Spec-driven Vibe-coding by combining the rapid, conversational generation power of \"vibe coding\" with the structure and architectural coherence provided by the \"spec-driven\" methodology. This is a enhanced Spec-Driven Development toolkit with patterns & templates for building scalable multi-agent AI systems. It is a practical fork of github/spec-kit for spec-driven development of agentic AI systems. It provides patterns, templates, and reference projects for building scalable, distributed multi-agent apps with the OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP, A2A, and a cloud-native runtime stack—Docker, Kubernetes, Dapr (Actors & Workflows), and Ray. Use it to define specs, spin up services, orchestrate agents, and ship production-ready stacks faster with guardrails and CI-friendly scaffolds.",
