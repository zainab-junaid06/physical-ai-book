# Contributing to SpecifyPlus

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to SpecifyPlus. This is the enhanced fork of GitHub's Spec Kit, focused on Spec-Driven Development for multi-agent AI systems.


Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Command Contributions

SpecifyPlus uses a **test-first contribution model** where you develop and validate commands in your own projects before contributing them to the core repository.

```bash
# 1. Create and test your command locally
specifyplus init my-test-project --ai claude
cd my-test-project
# Develop your command in .specify/templates/commands/
# Test thoroughly with /sp.your-command

# 2. Contribute to the core repository
git clone https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus.git
# Copy your tested files and submit a PR
```

## 📖 Detailed Contribution Guide

For comprehensive instructions, see our:
- **[Technical Implementation Guide](docs-plus/CONTRIBUTING_GUIDE.md)** - Complete workflow and technical details
- **[Quick Reference](README.md#-quick-reference)** - Common command patterns and examples

## 🔧 Prerequisites for Development

These are one-time installations required to test your changes locally:

1. Install [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package management
3. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. Have an [AI coding agent available](README.md#-supported-ai-agents)

### Development Environment Setup

<details>
<summary><b>💡 Hint if you're using <code>VSCode</code> or <code>GitHub Codespaces</code> as your IDE</b></summary>

<br>

Provided you have [Docker](https://docker.com) installed on your machine, you can leverage [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev) through this [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers), to easily set up your development environment, with aforementioned tools already installed and configured, thanks to the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file (located at the root of the project).

To do so, simply:

- Checkout the repo
- Open it with VSCode
- Open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and select "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container..."

On [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) it's even simpler, as it leverages the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` automatically upon opening the codespace.

## 🎯 Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

### 1. New Slash Commands (Most Common)
Create new workflow commands like `/sp.deploy`, `/sp.test`, `/sp.docs`

### 2. Template Improvements
Enhance existing templates for better functionality

### 3. Script Automation
Add shell scripts for complex workflows (Bash/PowerShell)

### 4. Documentation and Guides
Improve project documentation and methodology guides

### 5. Bug Fixes and Performance
Fix issues and optimize existing functionality

## 🔄 Contribution Workflow

### For Slash Commands (Primary Contribution Type)

#### Step 1: Local Development
```bash
# Create test project
specifyplus init test-command --ai claude
cd test-command

# Create your command template
# Edit: .specify/templates/commands/your-command.md
# Create supporting scripts if needed
# Test: /sp.your-command test-arguments
```

#### Step 2: Technical Implementation
SpecifyPlus uses the **Thin Scripts + AI Content Generation** pattern:

- **Scripts**: Create directory structure, copy templates with placeholders, return JSON metadata
- **AI**: Fill placeholders with generated content based on context and requirements

#### Step 3: Cross-Agent Testing
```bash
# Test with multiple agents if possible
specifyplus init test-gemini --ai gemini
# Test command: /sp.your-command

specifyplus init test-copilot --ai copilot
# Test command: /sp.your-command
```

#### Step 4: Submit to Core Repository
```bash
# Clone main repository
git clone https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus.git
cd spec-kit-plus

# Copy your tested files
cp ../test-command/.specify/templates/commands/your-command.md templates/commands/
cp ../test-command/.specify/scripts/bash/your-script.sh scripts/bash/  # if exists
cp ../test-command/.specify/scripts/powershell/your-script.ps1 scripts/powershell/  # if exists

# Submit PR
git checkout -b feature/your-command
git add .
git commit -m "Add /sp.your-command for [purpose]"
git push origin feature/your-command
# Submit Pull Request
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Contributions

### Local Testing Workflow

```bash
# 1. Test script directly
bash scripts/bash/your-script.sh --json
# Expected: JSON output with path/status

# 2. Test template creation
ls -la .specify/your-artifact.md
# Expected: File with {{PLACEHOLDERS}} intact

# 3. Test command in agent
/sp.your-command "test input"
# Expected: Filled placeholders, working command

# 4. Build validation
./.github/workflows/scripts/create-release-packages.sh v1.0.0-test
```

### Required Test Scenarios

- [ ] Command works with no arguments
- [ ] Command works with single and multiple arguments
- [ ] Command handles special characters in arguments
- [ ] Integration testing with SDD workflow (`/sp.specify` → `/sp.plan` → `/sp.tasks` → `/sp.implement` → `/sp.your-command`)
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (macOS/Linux/Windows) if possible

## 📋 Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Requirements

- [ ] **Local testing completed** - Command works in real project scenarios
- [ ] **Cross-agent compatibility** - Tested with multiple AI agents if possible
- [ ] **Documentation updated** - README.md, CHANGELOG.md updated if needed
- [ ] **AI assistance disclosed** - Any AI usage must be disclosed (see below)
- [ ] **Scripts executable** - `chmod +x scripts/bash/your-script.sh`

### Large Changes Notice

> [!NOTE]
> If your pull request introduces a large change that materially impacts the work of the CLI or repository (e.g., new templates, major workflow changes), ensure it was **discussed and agreed upon** by project maintainers beforehand.

### Increasing PR Acceptance

- Follow the project's coding conventions and style guidelines
- Include comprehensive testing scenarios
- Update documentation for user-facing features
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Write clear commit messages following conventional format
- Test with the Spec-Driven Development workflow to ensure compatibility

## 🤖 AI Assistance Disclosure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using **any kind of AI assistance** to contribute to SpecifyPlus, it **must be disclosed** in the pull request.

We welcome and encourage AI-enhanced contributions! However, transparency is required:

**Examples of disclosure:**
- "This command template was refined with ChatGPT assistance"
- "Shell scripts were generated by Claude Code"
- "No AI assistance used - fully manual creation"

**What requires disclosure:**
- Code generation assistance
- Template refinement with AI
- Documentation improvements with AI
- Any substantial AI contribution

**What doesn't require disclosure:**
- Trivial spacing or typo fixes
- Small grammatical corrections

Failure to disclose AI assistance is disrespectful to maintainers and may result in PR closure or contribution restrictions.

## 🔍 Development Workflow

When working on SpecifyPlus:

1. **Test changes locally** using `specifyplus init` and your preferred AI agent
2. **Verify templates** work correctly in the `templates/` directory
3. **Test script functionality** in the `scripts/` directory
4. **Ensure memory files** (`memory/constitution.md`) are updated for major process changes

### Local Package Testing

```bash
# Test your templates locally without full release
./.github/workflows/scripts/create-release-packages.sh v1.0.0-test

# Copy the relevant package to your test project
cp -r .genreleases/sdd-claude-package-sh/. <path-to-test-project>/

# Open and test the agent in your test project
```

## 📊 What We're Looking For

### Successful Contributions Include:
- **Clear AI use disclosure** with transparency about extent of assistance
- **Human understanding and testing** - you've personally validated the changes
- **Clear rationale** - explanation of why the change is needed and how it fits SpecifyPlus goals
- **Concrete evidence** - test cases, scenarios, or examples demonstrating improvement
- **Your own analysis** - thoughts on end-to-end developer experience

### What We'll Close:
- Untested changes submitted without verification
- Generic suggestions not addressing specific SpecifyPlus needs
- Bulk submissions showing no human review or understanding

### Guidelines for Success:
Demonstrate that you understand and have validated your proposed changes. If a maintainer can easily tell that a contribution was generated entirely by AI without human input or testing, it needs more work before submission.
